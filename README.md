# wordpress-plugins

Here is a collection of plugins I've created for Wordpress. Have fun!

---

## FeedBurner Awareness (`fb_awareness.php`)

Access your feed statistics using the FeedBurner Awareness API.

---

## Transform (`transform.php`)

This plugin is arguably the lamest, least useful, most idiotic, extremely
demented, and coolest plugin there is. You'll either scratch your head and say
"What the...", or smile and say "That's awesome...". The Transform plugin is a
filter that is used to transform your posts into hexadecimal, octal, decimal,
binary, the wicked memory dump form, or using an external application (i.e.
jive, swedish chef, h@x0r, etc).

## Import Blosxom Data (`import-blosxom.pgp`)

This importer allows you to extract posts from a Blosxom generated RSS 2.0 feed
file into your Wordpress blog.  This tool also has the ability to import
writebacks from the Blosxom **writeback** or **writeback_plus** plugins.

The feed should be generated using the included Blosxom **.rss20** theme.  If
you don't use themes then simply break the theme up into the necessary
individual flavour files.
